## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header=T, sep=",")
data$date <- as.Date(data$date)

library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(fig.path="figure/")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

First let's look at the steps per date data through an histogram.
```{r}
steps.per.date <- with(data, tapply(steps, date, sum, na.rm=T))
hist(
    steps.per.date,
    xlab="Steps per Date", ylab="Count",
    main="Steps per Date Histogram",
    col="blue"
)
```

As per the mean and median, we have the following:
```{r}
mean(steps.per.date)
median(steps.per.date)
```
